# Pokemon in python

A simple (when i say simple i don't quite mean that) pokemon battler that uses tkinter

Some of the fuctionalty of pokemon that was removed was switching outside of when you faint, speed and by proxy priorty calulation.

Some know issues that are there but i don't really want to fix right now are:
  - The movedisable fuction disables moves even when the pokemon is switched out
